Understand the language: First, thoroughly understand the language you want to interpret. This includes its syntax, semantics, data types, control structures, etc.
Choose a parsing technique: Decide whether you'll use a parser generator like ANTLR or write the parser manually. For simple languages, manual parsing might be sufficient.
Lexical Analysis (Tokenization): Write a lexer to convert the input source code into a stream of tokens. Each token represents a basic unit of the language, such as identifiers, keywords, operators, etc.
Syntax Analysis (Parsing): Write a parser to analyze the structure of the code based on the tokens generated by the lexer. This typically involves building an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the program's structure.
Semantic Analysis: Once you have the AST, perform semantic analysis to check for correctness beyond syntax, such as type checking, scoping rules, etc.
Intermediate Representation: Optionally, you may choose to generate an intermediate representation (IR) of the code. This can simplify subsequent steps and optimizations.
Interpreter or Code Generation: Depending on your goals, you can either directly interpret the AST or generate executable code from it. If interpreting, you'll typically implement an evaluation function that traverses the AST and executes the corresponding actions.





Build in Go simple Go interpreter in which errors are handled using try..catch

- Step 1 : write the parser manually
- Step 2 : Write a lexer to convert the input source code into a stream of tokens. Each token represents a basic unit of the language, such as identifiers, keywords, operators, etc.
- Step 3 : Write a parser to analyze the structure of the code based on the tokens generated by the lexer. This typically involves building an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the program's structure.
- Step 4 : Once you have the AST, perform semantic analysis to check for correctness beyond syntax, such as type checking, scoping rules, etc.
- Step 5 : generate an intermediate representation (IR) of the code
- Step 6 : implement an evaluation function that traverses the AST and executes the corresponding actions.
